# Room Bookings UI #

A Wordpress plugin for displaying information from the Room Bookings application (https://github.com/trevorprinn/room-bookings). Like the Room Bookings app, this is a WIP.

After installation and activation, the setup page allows the url for the Room Bookings api to be entered, together with a username and password for access. The shortcodes `[bookings]` and `[bookings_cal]` are then available to display some of the information about future bookings in a table, or a calendar, together with a form allowing the user to add a provisional booking.
